Manual testing for Jotto GUI
============================

Testing partition: Setting puzzle, making guess

I. Setting puzzle
	-on start of the GUI, there should already be a puzzle already selected
	we test steps each case of a followed by each case of b
	a. enter puzzle number:
		i.  negative
		ii. 0
		iii. has nonnumerical characters
		iv. positive  
	b. submitting puzzle number: 	
		i. pressing the button
		ii. hitting return on keyboard to submit
	Expected result: 
		a-i., a-ii., or a-iii. then b -> random puzzle generation
		a-iv. then b -> generate puzzle with submitted ID
		
II. Making guesses (on puzzle 1)
	a. Submitting guesses for puzzle 1
		i. submit a "hello" word and press enter -> print a "guess 2 1" response
		ii. submit "hell" -> print a error 2
		iii. submit a "hell*" -> print a delayed "guess 1 1" response
		iv. submit "tolas" -> print "you win!"
		
	b. Recording guesses: induce normal printout, error 0 (ill-formated), error 2 (Invalid guess)
		-type "hello" - expect guess 2 1 to appear
		-type "hell" -expect Invalid guess to show next to word
		-type "hell*" - expect guess 1 1 to appear
		-type "tolas" - expect "you win!"
		-expect scrollbar
		-reset puzzle, table should be clear
	
	c. Testing thread safety:
		a. On guesses:
		-type "hello" - expect guess 2 1
		-type "hell*", "fell*", "bell*", "crab!", "salt*", "salts"
			-each guess should appear immediately, 
			-responses for "hello", "crab!" and "salts"
				 should all appear immediately
			Final Result: 
			"hell*" guess 1 1
			"fell*" guess 1 1
			"bell*" guess 1 1
			"crab!" Invalid guess
			"salt*" guess 4 1
			"salts" guess 4 2
		b. On resetting puzzles:
		-type "hello" and reset puzzle to 1 -> updates table and changes puzzle
		-type "hell*" and reset puzzle to 1 
		-> resets puzzle text field to empty, updates the puzzle
		->after some time, nothing should appear 
		-type "hell*", "hello", results should appear as normal
